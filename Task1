"""
Basic Calculator Program in Python
This program implements a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
Users are prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation from the following options:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
"""
The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result.
