## Overview of the project

### creating a python program on simple caiculator

### Objective
The objective of the project is to develop a user-friendly Python program that serves as a basic calculator, allowing users to input two numbers, perform fundamental arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and display the result accurately.

### Key activities
Define Program Requirements: Determine the arithmetic operations to be supported: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Plan for user input and output methods.

Design the Program Structure: Decide on the sequence of operations and user interactions. Create a flowchart or pseudocode to outline the program logic.
Implement the Input Mechanism: Write code to prompt the user to enter two numbers. Ensure input validation to handle non-numeric values. 
Implement Operation Selection:Provide options for the user to select an arithmetic operation. Validate the user's choice to ensure it corresponds to a valid operation.

### Technologies used
Python:The main programming language used to write the calculator code. Provides built-in functions and operators for arithmetic operations.
Python Standard Library: Includes basic functions like input(), print(), and type conversion functions such as float() and int() for handling user input and output.

### Conclusion
The development of this simple calculator program in Python demonstrates the fundamental principles of arithmetic operations, user input handling, and basic error management. By implementing this project, you have gained practical experience in designing and coding a user-friendly application with essential features such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.This project lays a solid foundation for more advanced programming endeavors and serves as a stepping stone to exploring additional functionalities, such as graphical user interfaces or expanded mathematical operations. The knowledge gained from this task will be valuable for tackling more complex projects and furthering your development skills.
